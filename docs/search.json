    "text": "1 Introduction\nCancer is a broad term for a variety of diseases that arise from abnormal growth in the body. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world and that cancer deaths can be prevented if the disease is diagnosed early and treated appropriately. Some of the factors contributing to early diagnosis are the level of healthcare access a patient has and the healthcare policies in the country of residence. For example, women in countries with a lower human development index (HDI) are 50% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women in high HDI countries, but are more likely to die from breast cancer due to inequity in health care access and treatment. Additionally, there may be other barriers in access to diagnosis and treatment such as race, sex and age. In this project, we intend to explore trends for cancer diagnosis based on patient and country characteristics.\nWe chose this topic because we are interested in investigating the cancer rates and healthcare policies around the world and by U.S. state and potential trends that reveal more about cancer diagnosis. We plan to explore what factors might be related to a country’s cancer rate and cancer mortality rate, including looking at how much a country spends on healthcare, the number of physicians operating in a country, and whether the country has an operational policy/strategy for handling cancer. We also want to explore who is most affected by cancer (i.e. genders, ages, races, countries, and continents) and whether the governments’ policies on healthcare expenditures and/or health insurance systems play a role in positive or negative outcomes. We aim to explore how cancer rates differ by demographic group and by country (and state).\nSources: WHO Cancer Fact Sheet ; WHO Article: Global Cancer Burden Growing",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nUN/WHO Data on Health Expenditure by Country\nThis is from the United Nations website. The data look at how much countries spend on healthcare as a percentage of GDP and total government expenditure in the years 2005, 2010, 2015, 2018, 2019, and 2020. The data are collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) and reviewed annually using government expenditure records and official statistics. The WHO makes modifications and estimates when needed to ensure consistency and comprehensiveness. Some potential issues with this data involve differences in reporting standards for different countries. Some countries use a calendar year for their reports while others use fiscal years that start on many different days throughout the year depending on the country. The data are posted by the United Nations and was most recently updated on October 25, 2023 using data that was pulled in April 2023. The data are in csv format and have 2,262 rows and 7 columns. It will be imported into R as a csv file. Link to data.\nUN/WHO Data on Health Personnel by Country\nThis is also from the United Nations website. This data captures the raw number of physicians, nurses, dentists, and pharmacists operating in each country between the years 2000 and 2021. It also records the number of people working in these occupations per 1000 people in each country. The data is collected by the WHO from a combination of national reporting, national censuses, labor force surveys, and administrative and national sources. The definition of a health worker occupation is classified according to the definition of the International Standard Classification of Occupations. The dataset is not without complications. Given the disparate reporting methods of countries around the world, different countries report data for different years, and there is not a single year between 2000 and 2021 for which every country has reported data. Moreover, there is no single way that countries report or calculate this data, so different countries will be arriving at their estimates in different ways. The dataset was posted by the United Nations and was last updated on October 25, 2023, with data last being pulled in April 2023. The data comes as a csv file and has 5,884 rows and 7 columns. It will be imported to R as a csv. Link to data.\nWHO/GCO Data on Cancer Incidence and Mortality by Country\nThese datasets report the incidence rates and mortality rates of cancer by country in 2022. It is collected by the WHO and reported through the Global Cancer Observatory (GCO). The data are collected differently depending on the country. Some countries have national counts. Other countries have sub-national counts, and other countries do not have data so the WHO uses models to make estimates. This could pose some problems with analysis because the numbers for different countries are based on different methods of calculation. In some cases, the WHO extrapolates the data of a city or sub-region within the country to the overall country. In other cases, the WHO looks at rates in neighboring countries and applies those rates to the population of a country. Alternatively, they create models to estimate the prevalence and mortality rates. Because of the mix in raw data vs modeling data, it may not be comparing apples to apples in every country, but the WHO is the leading organization for this type of work and their numbers are probably the best that are possible to find. Both the incidence and mortality datasets have 13 columns and 186 rows. They are both csv files and will be imported into R as a csv. Link to incidence data. Link to mortality data.\nNational Center for Health Statistics - Percent Cancer Estimate for Demographics\nThis website is the National Center for Health Statistics website. This source collects data from the following source: the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The CDC selects survey participants yearly and attempts to survey them via telephone or in person via representative.The CDC conducts the survey. Survey responses are conducted via telephone or in person by a census bureau representative. The data is in a csv file and is imported into R. The data is a percentage of the group represented in the tab. Based on the website, the survey is completed yearly and there are results for each year from 2019-2023. The dimensions of this data in R is a data frame of 380 rows by 5 total columns.To import the data, each individual parameter should be downloaded as a csv file from the website for this data set. Then, each csv file should be read into R using read_csv from the tidyverse package. The data should then be merged together using full_join and join_by = (Year,Group,Subgroup,Estimate,Flag).\nLink: NCHS Cancer Data\nWHO: Existence of Operational Policy/Strategy/Action Plan for Cancer\nThe data seems to be collected per country and corresponds with a “yes” or “no” to the statement “Existence of operational policy/strategy/action plan for cancer.” There is no indication of how the countries are contacted or what questions they are asked to deduce the results. The World Health Organization collected this data. There is no indication of how countries were contacted or which questions they were asked to result in answer of “yes” or “no” in this data set. The data is located in csv files. There is an individual csv file that contains each parameter that is in selection drop down of the associated link. The csv files from this source are merged using full_join from the tidyverse package in R. The survey results are “yes”,”no” or “no response” to the existence of operational policies,strategies or action plans for cancer. The data was last updated on April 25th, 2022. However, there is no statement of how often the data is updated. Since, there is data for 2021, 2019, 2017, 2015, and 2013, it seems that data is collected every two years. The next update may be for the year 2023 if the update trend continues. The merged data (all parameters combined) is a data frame with 970 rows by 34 columns. Some countries have a value of “No Response” and their action plan for cancer cannot be assessed for certain years. This data can be downloaded as a csv file per parameter on the associated link and then read into RStudio using the read_csv function from the tidyverse package. Each file needs to be individually imported into R using the read_csv function.\nLink: WHO Data on Policies for Cancer",

It appears that 2010 and 2015 are the years that have the most countries reporting this data. 2005, 2020, and 2004 are also years where more countries have reported this data. To make up for the inconsistency of the reporting, we will ultimately take averages across several year spans in order to get usable data for the most countries possible. In this range, some countries will have reported data for several of the years. Others may have only reported data for one year, but averaging across several years of data will allow us to draw comparisons across as many countries as possible over a similar time span.\nWHO: Existence of Operational Policy/Strategy/Action Plan for Cancer\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nOperationalPolicy &lt;- read_csv(\"OperationalPolicy.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nCounts &lt;- OperationalPolicy |&gt; group_by(Value,Period) |&gt; summarise(count = n()) |&gt; mutate(Value =factor(Value))\n\n\nggplot(Counts, aes(x=fct_reorder(Value,count, .desc=TRUE), y = count, fill = \"red\")) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"Value From Survey\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Count of Recorded Responses\")+\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\",axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,size=8))+\n  facet_wrap(~Period)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis: The intended values of this survey are meant to be “yes” there exists a operational policy or plan for cancer or “no” there does not exist an operation policy or plan for cancer.

Much of the western world has very high cancer rates, with the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and much of northern and western Europe having more than 600 cases of cancer per 100,000 people. By contrast, most African countries have between 0 and 100 cases of cancer per 100,000 people. Asian and South American countries tend to fall somewhere in between these two extremes, though Japan has rates more similar to the West than to the rest of Asia. There are many reasons that could explain this disparity, which we will explore later. Some factors may have to do with lifestyle, or they may have to do with reporting bias. Do countries that have better medical infrastructure catch and report cancer at a higher rate? It is possible. Link to Cancer Incidence Rate Data",

For all continents except for Europe, regardless of the existence of an operational policy, the gap between Incidence Rates and Mortality Rates remains fairly constant. As one increases, the other increases by a similar rate. However, in Europe, for countries that have Operational Policies in place for cancer, the gap between Incidence and Mortality rate seems to expand and shows that Mortality Rate seems to peak around 375 per 100,000 people even though Incidence Rate continues to grow. Countries with incidence rates ranging from 400 to 800 cases per 100,000 all on average have cancer mortality rates that hover in the high 200s to low 300s per 100,000. This could indicate that the countries that have a larger gap between mortality and incidence rate either have more sensitive cancer detection methods, more rigorous cancer treatments available or easier access to healthcare. To further explore this question, we would need to look more into the types of cancer detection methods and treatments and compare access to healthcare for these countries. For example, it would be interesting to compare Denmark and Poland more closely as their mortality rates are similar, but their incidence rates are very different.\nAlso of note is just how many more countries have operational policies in place than not. There does not appear to be a substantial difference in cancer and mortality rates between countries that have an operational policy versus those that do not. Countries in Africa appear to have the most countries out of any continent not to have an operational policy, though the majority of African countries do have one.\nOne limitation of this plot is that the rates are from 2022 and the Operational Policy data is from 2021. During the data collection process, we were unable to find rates from 2021 or Operational Policy data for 2022 based on how the data is reported. Therefore, this plot does not represent the same year; however, we chose to move forward with this plot because there is potential for correlation and trend discovery between Operational Policy in 2021 and Rates in 2022 if the Operational Policies do not change. Afghanistan and Lesotho were filtered out of the data since they have no response for Operational Policy and their rates do not add value to the analysis since their rates are the same.

Countries that do not have an operational policy in place have similar risks for dying from cancer at age 74 while the incidence rate varies in this group. In countries with an operational policy, the mortality risk is generally similar across all continents; however, incidence risk seems to be the highest in Europe and some countries in Oceania, North America, and Asia. The trend observed in European countries that have operational policies suggests that there are excellent treatment opportunities or perhaps the cancers that people are at risk for are not as deadly. Though the risk of getting cancer in Europe appears higher than most other continents, the mortality risk is similar. The previous statement would need to be investigated further to understand the exact cause of this relationship. In Africa, countries that have existing operational policies show a small gap between mortality and incidence risk. Just like in the last graph, there does not appear to be a big difference between countries that have operational policies versus those that do not. The bigger dividing line appears to be continent.\nLink to Existence of Operational Policy Data Link to Cancer Mortality Rate Data Link to Cancer Incidence Rate Data",

Since we have incidence and mortality rates for the year 2022 and we have inconsistent data, reported for a variety of years, across countries for physician counts, GDP, and domestic spending, we will average the physician counts, GDP, and domestic spending across 2015-2021, which is the most recent data we have and the smallest range we can include that still encompasses the vast majority of countries. It will not be an exact one-to-one comparison, but it is still a similar time period, and it is the best estimate we can create given the data we have access to.\nWe see in the above graph that all five of the variables are right-skewed, with modes tending towards the lower end of the spectrum. The most common incident rate is around 100 per 100,000, most common mortality rate is slightly above 50 per 100,000, most common physician rate is less than 1 per 1,000, most common percent of GDP spent is around 5%, and most common percent of total domestic spending is slightly below 10%. We also see that incidence rate and mortality rate are very closely related, having a strong positive correlation of 0.946, which indicates that countries with higher rates of cancer also have higher rates of death from cancer. Interestingly, the incidence rate of cancer also has a positive correlation with the number of physicians operating in the country (0.785) and with the percentage of a country’s money spent on healthcare (0.624 for GDP, 0.624 for domestic spending). While correlation does not equal causation, one potential reason for this is that with more investment and more doctors working in a country, there are more opportunities to discover cancer. Mortality rate is also positively correlated with each of these three measures, though GDP spent and domestic spending are not as strongly correlated as they are with incidence rate.\nLink to Cancer Mortality Rate Data Link to Cancer Incidence Rate Data Link to Health Expenditure by Country Link to Health Personnel by Country",

At one extreme, one country (Cuba) has more than 8 physicians per 1,000 people and about 450 cancer cases per 100,000, while Japan has just 2.6 physicians per 1,000 people but a cancer rate of 800 per 100,000.

Overwhelmingly, countries that spend less and have fewer doctors have lower rates of cancer. More than half of countries that spend less than 5% of their GDP and have 0 to 2 physicians per 1,000 people have fewer than 100 cancer cases per 100,000. No country under these parameters has a cancer rate above 300 per 100,000. Notably, the limited number of countries that spend more than 10% of their GDP on healthcare but have 0 to 2 physicians per 1,000 people all have a cancer rate of less than 100. Contrarily, in countries with more than 2 physicians per 1,000 people, the cancer rates are much higher, regardless of how much they spend on healthcare. On top of that, as these countries spend more of their GDP on healthcare, the cancer rates increase even more to the point that every single country that has more than 2 physicians per 1,000 people and spends more than 10% of their GDP has a cancer rate of 300 or more per 100,000. The overwhelming majority of countries with 2 physicians per 1,000 that spend between 5-10% of their GDP also have cancer rates of more than 300 per 100,000. While this mosaic plot demonstrates a relationship between both GDP spending and cancer rates and number of physicians and cancer rates, it makes plain that the number of doctors has a much stronger relationship with cancer rates than the percent of a country’s GDP that is spent on healthcare.\nLink to Cancer Incidence Rate Data Link to Health Expenditure by Country Link to Health Personnel by Country",

Most countries in Europe spend between 10 and 20% of their total domestic spending on healthcare, have cancer rates of 400 to 800 people per 100,000, and have cancer mortality rates of 250+ per 100,000. This is far higher on average than any other continent. Africa falls on the other end of the extreme, with most countries having fewer than 200 cancer cases per 100,000 people, spending less than 10% of domestic spending on healthcare, and mostly having cancer mortality rates of less than 100 per 100,000 people. Asian and North American countries show more variation across these three metrics. There are Asian countries with incidence rates as low as 58 and as high as 800 per 100,000 people, with mortality rates as low as 26 and as high as 339 per 100,000, and with domestic spending as low as 2% and as high as 23%. Interestingly, Japan is the highest Asian country in all 3 of these categories. Also of note is how South American countries are similarly compact in their level of domestic spending as European countries, with almost all falling between 10% and 20%, yet their incidence and mortality rates are far lower than Europe’s. It goes to show that while there does appear to be a positive correlation between domestic spending and incidence rates, there are clearly other factors at play too.\nLink to Cancer Mortality Rate Data Link to Health Expenditure by Country Link to Health Personnel by Country",

European countries tend to be on the upper ends of many categories, particularly with incidence rate, incidence risk, and mortality rate. Countries in the other four continents do not fall into any clear clusters, indicating that they have more variation within them. Moreover, while variables like incidence rate and mortality rate tend to have clustering at the extremes, factors like percent of domestic spending on healthcare and percent of GDP spent on healthcare do not exhibit such stark distinctions. Interestingly, while incidence rate, incidence risk, and mortality rate tend to have many countries on the high end and low end with fewer in the middle, many countries coalesce towards the center when it comes to mortality risk.\nLink to Cancer Mortality Rate Data Link to Health Expenditure by Country Link to Health Personnel by Country",

While there is a slight decrease in the proportion of groups that are in the Mid percentage bin across the years, we see cancer percentages across groups are generally of equal proportions. While we are not tracking individual groups in this plot, we are able to see how proportions of cancer percentages vary over the years as a whole. From this graph, we can see that we will need to investigate individual groups more closely to identify where the differences come from.\nOne limitation of this data is that we are comparing the estimates across different groups and some individuals may belong to multiple groups; however, the reported data does not show where individuals are repeated.\nLink to US Cancer Estimates by Group",

While within each age subgroup, the cancer estimate remains relatively the same across the years, older groups have higher and higher estimated cancer rates. In the Race group, the White and American Indian, Alaska Native subgroups have higher cancer rates than Asian only or Black only. It would need to be investigated if the sampled population has different levels of access to health care or if this is a result of systemic policies in the healthcare system. Those who are in the unemployed (has worked previously) and not employed categories have higher rates of cancer than those in the never employed, full-time and employed categories. The difference between not employed and unemployed (worked previously) is unclear in the data source.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Based on our analysis of the data, the Western world tends to have both higher cancer incidence and cancer mortality rates All countries except European countries tend to have the same gap between incidence and mortality rate despite the existence or lack of operational policy for cancer. Countries that have higher incidence rates have a larger gap between incidence and mortality rates. The larger gap could be attributed to the countries that have higher incidence rates have technologies that are more sensitive to detecting cancer and treating cancer; however, this hypothesis would need to be explored further. As for cumulative risk of incidence of cancer and mortality by age 74, countries with operational policies tend to see higher rates. The highest rates belong to Asia, Europe and North America. It is worth reiterating that the cancer incidence and mortality rates may be estimated differently for each country and that countries may employ different types of policies in response to cancer diagnosis and treatment. This limitation should be explored in future analysis to find more specific trends and identify any bias in the current analysis.\nOne of the most significant takeaways is how correlated cancer incidence rates, cancer mortality rates, number of physicians per 1,000 people, and percentage of GDP and domestic spending that goes towards healthcare are. Each of these variables is positively correlated with one another, some more strongly than others. Countries that spend less and have fewer physicians have lower cancer rates and lower mortality rates. Future analysis could explore the nature of this correlation. Perhaps it has to do with methods of reporting - countries that invest less in their healthcare system and have fewer doctors to diagnose end up not finding as much cancer. A true explanation goes beyond the scope of this analysis. Another key trend we uncovered is that Europe tends to be on the high end of most of these metrics while Africa tends to be on the low end of these metrics. The other continents tend to vary more. We see this trend clearly and can customize the variables using our interactive graph.\nIn terms of cancer estimates in the US, the levels of percentages tend to remain constant over the years 2019-2023. There appear to be no differences in cancer estimates based on Urbanicity, Sex, Region and Poverty level. There appear to be higher rates of cancer in older age groups and among White and American Indian, Alaska Native Americans. One limitation of this dataset is that we cannot track an individual across groups. It would be useful to analyze individuals across groups if that data set was available.\nOverall, we conclude that there are differences among cancer and mortality rates across the world based on the amount of government spending on healthcare, the number of physicians per country, and the location of the country. We are somewhat limited with the conclusions we can draw because of some inconsistent methods of reporting and calculations that organizations used to acquire this data, and with needing to average across different years in order to get enough data in enough countries to draw meaningful comparisons. Though these are limitations, we are confident that our estimation techniques are effective enough to still bring insight into this area and to produce interesting and real findings. In the US, there are clear differences of cancer rates in some groups. As for future directions, it would be worthwhile to dive deeper into specific health policies and how those impact cancer incidence and mortality rates across the world and within demographic groups in the US.",
