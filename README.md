We are investigating cancer rates by country and by state and looking at who is most impacted and what factors may contribute to overall cancer rates. We want to explore who is most affected by cancer (i.e. genders, ages, races, and countries) and whether the governmentsâ€™ policies on healthcare expenditures and/or health insurance systems play a role in positive or negative outcomes. We aim to explore how cancer rates differ by demographic group and by country (and state). We also plan to explore whether both cancer rates and cancer mortality rates appear associated with different amounts of healthcare spending, the number of physicians operating in a country, and potentially even rates of insurance coverage within the population.
