# Conclusion


  Based on our analysis of the data, the western world tends to have both higher cancer incidence and mortality rates of cancer. All countries except european countries tend to have the same gap between incidence and mortality rate despite the existence or lack of operational policy for cancer. Countries that have higher incidence rates, have a larger gap between incidence and mortality rates. The larger gap could be attributed to the countries that have higher incidence rates have technologies that a re more sensitive to detecting cancer and treating cancer; however, this hypothesis would need to be explored further. Once again, the western world that has an operational policy in place sees higher rates of cancer incidence. As for cumulative risk of incidence of cancer and mortality by age 74, countries with operational policies tend to see higher rates. The highest rates belong to Asia, Europe and North America. It is worth reiterating that the cancer incidence and mortality rates may be estiamted differently for each country and that countries that employ different types of policies in response to cancer diagnosis and treatment. This limitation should be explored in future analysis to find more specific trends and identify any bias in the current analysis. 
  
  In terms of correlations, there is a strong positive correlation with incidence rate and mortality rate. Incidence rate has a positive correlation with the number of physicians and the amount of GDP spent on health care. Future analysis could explore if this correlation is causation or not. There is also a clear correlation that the countries that spend less and have fewer doctors have lower rates of cancer. Countries that have higher incidence rates and physician rates also have higher mortality rates from cancer. Europe is found to have 10-20% of their domestic spending on health care which could explain why European countries generally have similar mortality risk rates as shown in the first Cleveland dot plot.
  
  In terms of cancer estimates in the US, the levels of percentages tend to remain constant over the years 2019-2023 There appear to be no differences in cancer estimates based on Urbanicity, Sex, Region and Poverty level. There appear to be higher rates of cancer in older age groups and those belonging to the White and American Indian, Alaska Native and White subgroups. One limitation of this data set is that we cannot track an individual across groups. It would be useful to analyze individuals across groups if that data set was available.
  
    Overall, we conclude that are differences among cancer and mortality rates across the world based on the existence of operational policies, amount of government spending on healthcare and the number of physicians per country. In the US, there are clear differences of cancer rates in some groups. As for future directions, it would be worthwhile to dive deeper into specific health policies and how those impact cancer incidence, mortality rates across the world and the groups of indivdiuals in the US.
